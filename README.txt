DISCLAIMERS! PLEASE READ!

This is a work in progress and I don't pretend to understand all of the calculations!

It's based on my own tcl/Tk version (see: http://wiki.tcl.tk/12389) from 2005,
itself based on an web-article called "Lunar Phase Computation" by Stephen R. Schmitt from 2004
(that can be found on the google cache, but else, could be difficult to find nowdays...)
itself based on "Sky & Telescope, Astronomical Computing", April 1994

INTERACTIVITY:
* Current day: position the mouse right in the middle of the canvas. Date should be today's date.
* Futur days: move the mouse towards the right 
* Past days: move the mouse towards the left

Could add many things, like resizing depending on the distance from Earth, put the moon image with the correct rotation, etc.

Do whatever you want with it, but it'd be kind of you to send me corrections if you find any.
